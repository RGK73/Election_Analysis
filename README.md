  ## Challenge Overview
  After doing analysis and submitting election audit results to the election commisiion, they requested some additional data to complete the audit.
  1.The voter turnout for each county
  2.The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
  3.The county with the highest turnout
    
  ## Challenge Summary
  For the additinal data for audit, we have to read counties from the given data source and extract the number of counties first.
  Then by using repetition statements like for loops, conditional statements with logical operators like if and >, and using f strings in print statements, we were able to format the results in the way as wanted by election commisssion.
